    <p>
    This 68-minute opus from San Francisco's Paddlefoot doesn't pull any
    punches. Songs like "64 Corvair, Part 2", "Whiskey Before Breakfast",
    and "The Murphy-Ryan Polkas" mix traditional American and Irish fiddle
    tunes with indie rock. The result is somewhere between The Pogues, Camper
    Van Beethoven, and Uncle Tupelo. The sincerity and quirkiness of other songs
    like "When I Was Nine" and "Tiny House" are more reminiscent of Jonathan Richman.
